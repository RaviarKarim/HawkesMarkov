### Introduction

This repository contains the code used for the simulation studies of the paper: **Markovian multivariate Hawkes population processes: efficient evaluation of moments**. 

---


### Code

The Initialization Jupyter Notebook contains the relevant packages and introduces the parameters needed to run the code. Each Jupyter Notebook contains functions for a specific method of computing moments. In this code, we assume that the random jump sizes $B_{ij}$ are Exponentially distributed. This is important as it appears in the moments of $B_{ij}$, often convoluted, expressions of large matrices and constants.
